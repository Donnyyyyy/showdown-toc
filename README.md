# showdown-toc

Table of Contents extension for the showdown JavaScript Markdown parser.

This is not (IMO) release quality software. I needed automatic Table of Contents for a project and
couldn't find anything that worked with showdown at the time. I thought I'd release it in case
anyone else was in the same position.

This was developed with the original 2007 John Fraser showdown from http://www.attacklab.net/. It
*may* work with the new (official?) [showdownjs](https://github.com/showdownjs) but has not yet been
tested. YMMV.

Please let me know the results if you try it and I'll update this file.

## Usage

Include it in your HTML after you include showdown.js.

```html
<script src="showdown.js"></script>
<script src="showdown-toc.js"></script>
```

Initialize the converter with option `{ extensions: ['showdown-toc'] }`.

Then in your markdown just put a `[toc]` where you want a Table of Contents to appear. This
extension will look for the first header after the [toc] and use whatever it finds first as the
element for the rest of the TOC.

You can have multiple `[toc]` in a file, each one will show a Table of Contents for headers after it
(and before the next [toc]).

If you move up a level from the headers being used for a [toc], the Table of Contents will stop (the
assumption being you're "outside" of that section).

## Example

### Markdown Input

```markdown
# Main Page Heading
This is the intro to the main page.

## Section 1
A story.

[toc]

### Part 1
It was a nice day.

### Part 2
There were stormy clouds on the horizon.

#### Part 2A
They were very dark.

### Part 3
Then it rained.

## Section 2
Notice the section 2 header above is not included in the TOC of section 1? That's 
because each toc tag assumes it should stay in it's own section.

[toc]

### Part 1

### Part 2

#### Part 2A
Notice this heading isn't in the contents above. We only index the top level 
headings in each section, to keep things tidy. You may or may not like this, but 
that's the way it is. If you want to create a pull request with an option, 
you're welcome to! :)

### Part 3

The End.
```
